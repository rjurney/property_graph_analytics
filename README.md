# Property Graph Analytics

## Introduction

Property graphs are multi-relational graphs with both node and edge properties. What does that mean? 

One thing it means is that nodes or vertices (things in a data model) can have properties along with their name that define them. A "person" node might have height, weight, profile or title. An edge (relationships between things in a data model) might have a strength attribute modeling the strength of the relationship, a date/time for when the relationship was created or when it occurred, a place attribute modeling where the action that defines the relationship happened or anything else describing the relationship 

Another thing it means is that unlike traditional graphs, property graphs can have as many edge (relationship) types as they want. Friend, enemy, coauthor and coworker are just a few relationship types you might create to model a business network. Algorithms using more than one type of relationship are much more powerful than those that use just one type. 

## Graph Algorithms

What good are graphs? They are as good as the algorithms we can run on them, using them as the data for the algorithm.
